Equip them, so you don't have to go to the Equipment menu to equip the item you want. Even discard them, if you no longer want an item in your inventory, but bear in mind that doing so will discard all the items you have of that type, that is, discarding an item that you have 10 amounts of, for example, will cause all 10 of your amounts to be discarded."

testers_text_001,"Please understand that the game is ""empty"" because I've only focused on the game menus so far! But from now on I'm focusing on gameplay, equipment, maps and enemies.[n]Most of the weapons and armor are missing their images, animations and descriptions because I haven't worked on them yet (the only one that already has a move set is the Worn Bastard Sword, but it hasn't been properly finalized). I'm focusing first on adding new things that are more important to the game's progress, such as maps, enemies, npcs, etc."
